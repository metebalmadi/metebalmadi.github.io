<p>I am Meteb Almadi, and I attend DGMD course and that is my journal about the people card.</p>
<p>Well, my partner is <i> <u>Nitya Maddineni</u> </i> and my card will represent her as much as I can and I wrote her favorite stuff on a paper </p>

<p>I presented three different cards to her and they are down here:</p>

<img src= "Man.JPG" width="300px" height="300px">
<img src="Snake.JPG" width="300px" height="300px">

<img src="Man.JPG" width="300px"  height="300px">

<p> Well, what I had in mind was to change the color of the background to black, since it was her favorite color and change the picture to a star shape instead of a square.</p>
<p>I thought that it would be great to change the color of the star to shinny gold.</p>
<div>It would be a surprise for her. </div>
<p>Well, Here is my unfinished card of Nitya:</p>
