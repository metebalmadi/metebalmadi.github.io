<p>I am Meteb Almadi, and I attend DGMD course and that is my journal about the people card.</p>
<p>Well, my partner is <i> <u>Nitya Maddineni</u> </i> and my card will represent her as much as I can and I wrote her favorite stuff on a paper </p>

<div><b>Here it is:</b></div>
<br>
<img src= "CAT.JPG" width="300px"  height="300px">
<br>
<p>I presented three different cards to her and they are down here:</p>
<img src="DOG.JPG" width="300px" height="300px">


<img src= "Man.JPG" width="300px" height="300px">
<img src="Snake.JPG" width="300px" height="300px">
<br>
<br>
<div>After asking my partner Nitya about which one she liked although I forgot to ask her for a picture, she chose this one:</div>
<br>
<br>
<img src="Man.JPG" width="300px"  height="300px">

<p> Well, what I had in mind was to change the color of the background to black, since it was her favorite color and change the picture to a star shape instead of a square.</p>
<p>I thought that it would be great to change the color of the star to shinny gold.</p>
<div>It would be a surprise for her. </div>
<p>Well, Here is my unfinished card of Nitya:</p>

<div>Well, for my personal project mock ups I willprogram a game using scratch that will be like this:</div>

<br>
<img src="pmock-ups1.jpg" height="400px"  width="400px">
<br>
<p>In today's lesson, we had the chance to discuss the project topic and I started with my idea which is drawing each sprite and putting them together to make the space background. In the next lesson I will hopefully will be done by the coding part and coding is an open field so I would need the cooperation od the teaching team and their care to guide me finish this project.</p>
